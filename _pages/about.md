I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in political economy and development economics. My research lies in examining how internal migration shapes political dynamics, with a particular focus on disparities in redistribution.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Chair of International and Development Politics at Heidelberg University under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Axel Dreher](https://axel-dreher.de/)  

I hold a Master's degree in Quantitative Economics from Goethe University Frankfurt and a Master's degree in Economics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), where I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics.
